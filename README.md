## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps supply chain managers understand the efficiency of their operations. It provides insights into key areas such as delivery times, order accuracy, and customer satisfaction, allowing the business to pinpoint areas that require improvement. By analyzing ratings from customers and metrics like order delays, the company can identify bottlenecks and optimize its logistics process.

With around 57% of neutral/dissatisfied customers and 43% of satisfied customers, there is a clear need to enhance service quality. The average delay in deliveries is around 15 minutes, indicating room for improvement in operational speed and coordination.

The dashboard also highlights factors contributing to these delays, enabling the business to implement strategies to minimize disruptions and improve overall supply chain performance.





## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into the supply chain data, focusing on key metrics such as shipping performance, carrier efficiency, inventory levels, and product delivery times. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the supply chain operations, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
